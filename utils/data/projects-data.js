I successfully integrated the Directory Sync Service with major platforms such as Google Directories, Azure AD, and Okta Universal Directory, thereby enhancing the functionality of key products like Prisma Access and Cortex Extended Detection and Response. Additionally, I designed and implemented a distributed microservice architecture capable of supporting over 80 million users, while also optimizing MongoDB indexing to significantly boost query performance.",
